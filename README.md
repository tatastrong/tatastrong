### Hi there, my name is TatianaðŸ‘‹

I'm a statistics specialist with years of experience working in the public sector. Year ago I started learning Python and SQL, which allowed me to tackle more complex data analysis tasks. I use libraries like pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy and plotly and folium for data processing and visualization, as well as basic SQL queries and window functions for working with databases. 

Now I'm seeking an opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills in the IT industry and grow in the field of product analytics. I'm open to new challenges and ready to learn and develop in this area.
